<p>I am a Fellow at Insight Data Science, a career transition program for academics in quantitative fields to become familiar with data science in industry and find fulfilling and exciting roles in Insight-partnered companies. Before moving to New York in late May, I had spent over 6 years as a doctoral student in Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I designed molecular dynamics simulations to study the behavior of protein molecules and how they perform their functions.</p> 

<p>At Insight, I worked on a consulting project with a company to implement a machine learning solution for detecting and correcting misclassifications in a database of entries consisting of unstructured short text descriptions.
I built a natural language processing model that uses semantic relationships between words to match descriptions to the correct category names by comparing how similar words in the descriptions were to different category names. This blog is a record of how I embarked on this learning journey.</p>
