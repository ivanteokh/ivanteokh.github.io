<p>I am a Fellow at Insight Data Science, a career transition program for academics in quantitative fields to become familiar with data science in industry and find fulfilling and exciting roles in Insight-partnered companies. Before moving to New York in late May, I had spent over 6 years as a doctoral student in Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I designed and ran molecular dynamics simulations to study the behavior of protein molecules and how they perform their functions.</p> 

<p>At Insight, I worked on a consulting project with Cinch Financial to classify their customers' transactions based on short, unstructured descriptions.
I built a natural language processing model that uses semantic relationships between words to match transaction descriptions to the correct category descriptions by comparing how similar words in the transaction descriptions were to different category descriptions. This blog is a record of how I embarked on this learning journey.</p>
