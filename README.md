# myBlog 

This blog was built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
It is a user-friendly, intuitive, and powerful tool, and I highly recommend it.
One thing it allows you to do is install customized layouts. Mine was taken from
[zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/).

I started this blog as a platform to describe a project I did as a Fellow at Insight
Data Science. I would love to provide the code, but am obliged under an NDA to keep it under wraps.
Fortunately, you can get a detailed technical description from the first post. 

Eventually, I decided to start posting other data science-y topics here too. Any observation of interest,
personal projects, non-NDA-ed work projects are potential topics. If you have any ideas for a post, please
definitely shoot me an email at [ivan.teo.gy@gmail.com](mailto:ivan.teo.gy@gmail.com).

Enjoy!.
